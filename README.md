# Cupcake Corner
In this project we’re going to build a multi-screen app for ordering cupcakes. This will use a couple of forms, which are old news for you, but we’re also going to learn how to send and receive the order data from the internet, how to validate forms, and more.


### What we will learn?
SwiftUI’s forms, 
pickers, 
steppers, 
navigation 
and build them into an app that sends all the user’s data off to a server and processes the response.
